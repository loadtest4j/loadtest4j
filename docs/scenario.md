# The Scenario

A scenario is a service usage pattern, defined as a sequence of one or more `Request`s.

A load test is rarely about hammering a single endpoint. Instead, a realistic scenario should model the flow of requests that a user would perform. You should be able to derive this from a User Story definition.
