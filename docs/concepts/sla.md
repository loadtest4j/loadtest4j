# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

The performance guarantees that you provide to clients of your service.

## Measurements

An effective SLA should include one or more of the following measurements. Collaborate with your project stakeholders to choose the appropriate measurements for your service. 

### Knockout Rate

The percentage of requests that are allowed to fail (also called the 'percent KO').

### Requests Per Second

The minimum acceptable throughput for your service.

### Response Time

The maximum amount of time that requests are allowed to take.

This is measured in terms of **percentiles**. For example, if the SLA defines a 95th percentile response time of 500ms, this means 95% of requests must complete in 500ms or less, while 5% may take longer.

The percentiles measured in the SLA depend on the purpose of the service.

Response Time SLAs generally fall under one of Gil Tene's archetypes. He provides an excellent introduction to service performance archetypes in his presentatation ['How not to measure latency'](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-pitfalls). They are summarised below.

#### Archetype: Athlete

*Goal: Win some gold medals.*

The Athlete needs to be faster than everyone else in N% of races. Where N = desired percentage of races to win.

Example: There are 5 races. The Athlete wants to win 3 gold medals. So they must be faster than all their competitors in 60% of races. N = 60.

Key percentiles:

- pN

#### Archetype: Pacemaker (hard real-time)

*Goal: Keep the heart beating.*

Key percentiles:

- Max (p100)

#### Archetype: Trader (soft real-time)

*Goals: Be fast enough to make some good trades. Contain risk while you do it.*

Key percentiles:

- Median (p50)
- Max (p100)

#### Archetype: Interactive App (squishy real-time)

*Goal: Keep users happy (donâ€™t make them leave).*

Key percentiles:

- p90
- p99
- Max (p100)

## Sidenote: The executable SLA

Loadtest4j makes your Service Level Agreement (SLA) **executable**.

When you write a test case with assertions on the load test `Result`, you reify a part of that SLA in an executable and verifiable form.
