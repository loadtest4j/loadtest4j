# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

The performance guarantees that you provide to clients of your service.

## Measurements

An effective SLA should include one or more of the following measurements. Collaborate with your project stakeholders to choose the appropriate measurements for your service. 

### Knockout Rate

The percentage of requests that are allowed to fail (also called the 'percent KO').

### Requests Per Second

The minimum acceptable throughput for your service.

### Response Time

The maximum amount of time that requests are allowed to take.

This is measured in terms of **percentiles**. For example, if the SLA defines a 95th percentile response time of 500ms, this means 95% of requests must complete in 500ms or less, while 5% may take longer.

The percentiles measured in the SLA depend on the purpose of the service.

## Archetypes

Gil Tene provides an excellent introduction to service performance archetypes in his presentatation ['How not to measure latency'](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-pitfalls). They are summarised below.

### Athlete

**Goal: Win some gold medals.**

Key measurements:

- TODO add

### Pacemaker (hard real-time)

**Goal: Keep the heart beating.**

Key measurements:

- Percent KO = 0
- Max Response Time (p100)

### Trader (soft real-time)

**Goals: Be fast enough to make some good trades. Contain risk while you do it.**

Key measurements:

- Median Response Time (p50)
- Max Response Time (p100)

### Interactive App (squishy real-time)

**Goal: Keep users happy (donâ€™t make them leave).**

Key measurements:

- p90 Response Time
- p99 Response Time
- Max Response Time (p100)

## Sidenote: The executable SLA

Loadtest4j makes your Service Level Agreement (SLA) **executable**.

When you write a test case with assertions on the load test `Result`, you reify a part of that SLA in an executable and verifiable form.
